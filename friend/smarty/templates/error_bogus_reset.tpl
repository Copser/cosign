<h5>FRIEND ACCOUNT : ERROR </h5>

<p>
    {$error}
    Perhaps it has been too long since you began the password reset
    process?

<p>
    Please double-check your URL and try again, or <a
    href="/friend/reset/">submit a new request</a> to get a new e-mail message.
    If it has been more than an hour since you submitted your original
    request then you will almost certainly need to start over with a
    fresh request.
