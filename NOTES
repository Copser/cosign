MODULE:

unhappy with cookieparsing in cosign_auth().
unhappy with cookie_valid/read_secant division. 

upon cookie_ok, module sets up cgi env ( remote user etc )
    snprintf( tfname, MAXPATHLEN - 1 , "%s%s", TICKET_PREFIX, user );
    /* aka "/ticket/kerb.canna" in current system */
    krb_set_tkt_string( tfname );
    ap_table_set( r->subprocess_env, "KRBTKFILE", tfname );
    ap_table_set( r->subprocess_env, "REMOTE_REALM", realm );
    r->connection->user is REMOTE_USER, i believe
otherwise, do we redirect? must discuss.

Misc notes:

configuration files:

    module:  configured entirely in web server config files.  has
	    a directive that lists which tickets it will ask for
	    per location?  per directory?  per server?  all of the
	    above?

    cosignd: has a list ( in /usr/local/etc/cosign.conf? ) of
	    services, which tickets they can request, top of site,
	    top of site policy, name of service for display ( e.g.
	    "Conferencing on the Web" ), name of service for cookies
	    minus cosign- ( e.g.  "cow" ), is include in service list?.

	    possible additions:
	    audience (for service list)

	    structure: flat text file -- csv?  pipe delimited?
		    elephant/cheese delimited?

    cosign.cgi: uses same conf file as cosignd.
