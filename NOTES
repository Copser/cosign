MODULE:

    unhappy with cookieparsing in cosign_auth().
    unhappy with cookie_valid/read_secant division. 

    TODO:
    cookie obscuring - post 1.0
    *k5 needs ironing out

CGI:
    initial info and ticket propogation (belt)
    conf file

COSIGND:
    replication (suspenders)
    more conf file

ISSUES:
*1) use of cookie to store referer - should we do qs instead?

Protocol:

cosign.cgi:
    LOGIN login_cookie ip princ realm "kerberos"
    LOGOUT login_cookie ip
    REGISTER login_cookie ip service_cookie
    CHECK login_cookie

mod_cosign:
    CHECK service_cookie
    RETRIEVE service_cookie ip tkt 

cosignd:
    POLL timestamp

everyone:
    STARTTLS
    NOOP: no op.
    QUIT: quit

Misc notes:
    -request creds again per service ( during register )
    -warning when using sso ( during register )

configuration files:


    cosignd: has a list ( in /usr/local/etc/cosign.conf? ) of
	    services, which tickets they can request.

    cosign.cgi: service menu top of site,
	    top of site policy, name of service for display ( e.g.
	    "Conferencing on the Web" ), name of service for cookies
	    minus cosign- ( e.g.  "cow" ), is include in service list?.
