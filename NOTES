MODULE:

    unhappy with cookieparsing in cosign_auth().
    unhappy with cookie_valid/read_secant division. 

    TODO:
    cookie obscuring - post 1.0

CGI:
    initial info and ticket propogation (belt)
    conf file
    get a ticket with the keytab
    screens
    service menu

COSIGND:
    replication (suspenders)
    more conf file

ISSUES:
1) use of qs for redirect back URL ( consistency ).
2) IE 5.2 on X doesn't redirect properly.
2a) use of cookie to store referer - should we do qs instead?

Protocol:

cosign.cgi:
    LOGIN login_cookie ip princ realm [ tgt ]
    LOGOUT login_cookie ip
    REGISTER login_cookie ip service_cookie
    CHECK login_cookie

mod_cosign:
    CHECK service_cookie
    RETRIEVE service_cookie ip [ tkt ]

cosignd:
    POLL timestamp

everyone:
    STARTTLS
    NOOP: no op.
    QUIT: quit

Misc notes:

configuration files:

    module:  configured entirely in web server config files.  has
	    a directive that lists which tickets it will ask for
	    per location?  per directory?  per server?  all of the
	    above?

    cosignd: has a list ( in /usr/local/etc/cosign.conf? ) of
	    services, which tickets they can request, top of site,
	    top of site policy, name of service for display ( e.g.
	    "Conferencing on the Web" ), name of service for cookies
	    minus cosign- ( e.g.  "cow" ), is include in service list?.

	    possible additions:
	    audience (for service list)
