Some things to know:

make will build the apache filter only
make install will install the filter using apxs

make all will build the filter, the daemon and the cgi
make install-all installs all :)

In order for the filter to work, you'll need a directory called 
	/var/cosign/filter

It must be permitted so the user that runs the webserver has write
permission to it.

you'll want to run something like this out of cron daily:

find /var/cosign -type f -mtime +1 -exec rm {} \;

In the U of M environment, you'll want your directives to look like
this:

on your insecure side, and any dirs or locations you want exempt:

CosignProtected		Off

in :443 ( or otherwise https ) vhost

CosignProtetced		On
CosignHostname		weblogin.umich.edu
CosignRedirect		https://weblogin.umich.edu
CosignPostErrorRedirect	<will have a central one, for now any will do>
CosignService		<send e-mail to cosign@umich.edu>
CosignCrypto		<path to key> <path to cert> <path to CA>

Contact webmaster@umich.edu for umich CA certs, which are free!

It'll get rid of any files that have not been modified in the last day.

The daemon (cosignd) requires  /var/cosign/daemon to exist and be
writeable by the user the daemon runs as.

An init script will be inluded next time :)
