Some things to know:

'make' will build the apache filter only
'make install' will install the filter using apxs

'make everything' will build the filter, the daemon and the cgi
'make install-all' installs all :)

In order for the filter to work, you'll need a directory called 
	/var/cosign/filter

It must be permitted so the user that runs the webserver has write
permission to it.

In the U of M environment, you'll want your directives to look like
this:

on your insecure side, and any dirs or locations you want exempt:

CosignProtected		Off

in :443 ( or otherwise https ) vhost

CosignProtected		On
CosignHostname		weblogin.umich.edu
CosignRedirect		https://weblogin.umich.edu/
( NOTE: trailing slash is required! The redirects won't work correctly
without it! )
CosignPostErrorRedirect https://weblogin.umich.edu/post_error.html
CosignService		<send e-mail to cosign@umich.edu and we will assign>
CosignCrypto		<path to key> <path to cert> <path to CA directory>

[new in 0.9.x]
You'll now need a CA directory instead of just a CA. this is so we can
use umweb, verisign or entrust signed certs. Copy the CAs to your cadir
and issue the c_rehash command:
    % c_rehash /usr/local/etc/apache/certs
you should see something similar to:
    Doing /usr/local/etc/apache/certs
    umwebCA.pem => 4700e8dd.0
    RSA-SSCA.pem => f73e89fd.0
    entrust.pem => ed524cf5.0

Contact webmaster@umich.edu for umich CA certs, which are free!

The daemon (cosignd) requires  /var/cosign/daemon to exist and be
writeable by the user the daemon runs as.

--with-cosigndb=DIR overrides this default
--with-cosignconf=FILE -> allows you to specify new conf file location
default is /usr/local/etc/cosign.conf

--with-cosigncadir=DIR	default=/var/cosign/certs/CA 
--with-cosigncert=FILE	default=/var/cosign/certs/cert.pem
--with-cosignkey=FILE	default=/var/cosign/certs/key.pem
